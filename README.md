# cents-per-point

Consider the following situation:

You have 50,000 credit card points you wish to spend on hotels for a trip. You go to your favorite hotel program and look through the options. Consider two.

50,000 points or $500 cash

or

50,000 points or $2000 cash

Any rational person would pick the second one, as they are the same amount of points, but if people are willing to pay 4x the amount in cash, it is likely to be a better quality hotel. The metric that can be used to measure this is "cents per point," essentially the relative value of your points when compared across different redemption options.

Cents-Per-Point is a Chrome extension designed to better allow you evaluate points vs cash decisions when considering booking hotels with points. Currently works with Hyatt, Hilton, and Marriott hotel websites. Chrome extension adds a third currency, "cents per point", beneath cash and points rates to better assess relative value
